# 🚀 JavaScript Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects Repository!  
This is a growing collection of **real-world JavaScript projects** built with 💡 creativity, 📚 knowledge, and 🔨 hands-on problem solving. Every project here is a step in my journey to master core web development using **Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS** — no frameworks, just raw logic and clean code.

> 🌱 Currently adding projects — this repo will expand to 20–30 unique builds!
